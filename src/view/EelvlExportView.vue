      <v-row> EELVL is a file format that was used by Everybody Edits (EE). </v-row>
      <v-row>
        Here you can export EE worlds from PixelWalker to .eelvl file and open it up in Everybody Edits: Offline (EEO)
        client.

        Compared with PixelWalker, EELVL doesn't have:
        <ul>
          <li>Climbable horizontal chains and rope.</li>
          <li>
            Local/global switch activator block. EELVL has limited version of this, that is equivalent to switch
            activator, that always sets switch state to off. If switch activator is set to off, it'll be replaced with
            EELVL equivalent. If switch activator is set to on, it'll be replaced with normal sign that contains switch
            id and on/off value.
          </li>
          <li>Local/global switch resetter block.</li>
          <li>
            Multiple notes per music block - in EELVL it's limited to 1. If there is 1 note, it's replaced with note.
            Otherwise, replaced with text sign containing notes.
          </li>
          <li>Cyan and magenta spikes.</li>
          <li>Generic yellow face smile/frown block.</li>
          <li>
            All 4 rotation variants of corner decorations. Usually it has just 2 rotation variants (like snow, web,
            beach sand, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>Green sign.</li>
          <li>Purple mineral block.</li>
          <li>Plate with cake chocolate and pie cherry.</li>
          <li>
            A use for world portal. There is no way to enter PixelWalker world id and then open browser to join it. So
            it's always replaced with world id pointing to "Current" with id 1.
          </li>
          <li>A use for world portal spawn. Same as world portal, so id always replaced with 1.</li>
          <li>Hex Backgrounds.</li>
          <li>Counter blocks.</li>
          <li>Orange, yellow, cyan and purple canvas foreground blocks.</li>
          <li>Bronze and silver colours of gilded block pack</li>
          <li>
            Multiple layers: water, fog and some decorations are placed on overlay layer. If there are blocks in overlay
            and foreground layer, blocks in overlay layer are not exported
          </li>
          <li>Strings in portal ID and portal target ID</li>
          <li>White and black crystal</li>
          <li>1px and 2px outlines</li>
          <li>Red, blue and black outerspace decorations that also act as signs</li>
        </ul>
      </v-row>
      <v-row>All missing blocks are replaced with sign (except for backgrounds).</v-row>
      <v-row>
        <br />
        Fun fact: Signs only let you enter 140 characters in EEO. But it will happily accept EELVL file which has sign
        with more than 140 characters and will correctly show in game.
