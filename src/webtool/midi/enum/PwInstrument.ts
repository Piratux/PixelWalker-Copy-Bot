// Used MuseScore Studio 4 as source for these mappings from:
// - Drum Kit (large) - percussion
// - Hand Clap - percussion
// There is similar names here too: https://soundprogramming.net/file-formats/general-midi-drum-note-numbers/
// `_` like in `F_2` stands for sharp (#) due to TS variable naming restrictions
